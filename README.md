Instructions
While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range 
suggested by your doctors and trainers. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeartRates), 
the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. 

Your target heart rate is 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. Write a script that prompts for and inputs the user’s age and 
calculates and displays the user’s maximum heart rate and the range of the user’s target heart rate. 

*These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA; maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness, and 
gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified healthcare professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.

You will need to use your IDE to complete this assignment. Once completed, please submit your .py file to D2L.
